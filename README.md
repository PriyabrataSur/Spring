ðŸŒ± My Spring Framework Learning Journey
This repository contains a collection of small projects and code examples created as I learn the fundamentals of the Spring and Spring Boot frameworks. Each folder or module is dedicated to a specific concept.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of This Repository
The main goal of this repository is to document my learning process and create a personal reference for core Spring concepts. It's a hands-on approach to understanding the framework, moving from basic principles to more advanced features.

This is not a single, large application, but rather a series of focused, independent examples.
